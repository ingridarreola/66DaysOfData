# 66DaysOfData
Projects that I'm working on as a part of 66 Days of Data

Adding in additional projects as they come up. 

## Reveal.js
Learned about how slides can be created within Github Pages and am interested in using this instead of something like google slides or google drive. Want to use this as a solution for data literacy and want to practice with new projects inside this repository.
